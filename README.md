## Causal Inference for Improved Clinical Collaborations: A Practicum

*Date:* Thursday, 28th of August 2025, 09:15 - 13:00

*Location:* Biozentrum U1.111

*Organizers:* Alex Ocampo, Cristina Sotto & Jinesh Shah in collaboration with the PSI special interest group in causal inference

## Short description
Causal inference is emerging as an indispensable tool for statisticians to properly answer clinical questions of interest. This is due to a mathematically rigorous framework - i.e. potential outcomes - that can explicitly formalize causal effects (estimands) of interest and their identification assumptions. An often-overlooked benefit of adopting a causal toolkit is that it can help create a bridge between statisticians and subject matter experts. For example, causal diagrams can visualize the interplay between various clinical factors and the paths on these diagrams can be used to identify effects of interest together with clinical colleagues. Additionally, causal effects can be defined with simple contrasts of potential outcomes which are generally more closely related to clinical questions than the parameters of statistical models.

This mini symposium will equip participants with fundamental tools from causal inference to enable them to improve their collaborations with clinicians and other non-statistician subject matter experts. Through an introductory lecture on causal inference, a guided hands-on practicum in small breakout groups, and a panel discussion with causal inference experts, attendees of this mini symposium will have the chance to experience how causal inference can assist in improving collaborations between statisticians and clinicians.
